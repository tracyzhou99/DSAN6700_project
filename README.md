# DSAN6700 - App Deployment for PCOS Classification

### Introduction

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder that impacts women of reproductive age,
potentially causing symptoms like hormonal imbalances, irregular menstrual cycles, and emotional
disturbances, as recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO). It affects approximately 8–13%
of women in their reproductive years, with as many as 70% of cases going unnoticed. Diagnosing PCOS
can be challenging since its symptoms can be attributed to various factors, such as heavy menstrual
bleeding.

Georgetown University is deeply committed to fostering an environment focused on personalized patient
care, tailored to individual needs. In pursuit of this mission, the university is embarking on the
development of an application aimed at promptly identifying and diagnosing PCOS upon the entry of a
patient's laboratory results into the system. The ultimate goal is to increase the rate of diagnosis.

To support this endeavor, our project group designed an application based on machine-learning
approaches that harness existing patient data to enhance the speed and precision of PCOS diagnosis. The
data used is from Kaggle called PCOS Diagnosis. The dataset contains 45 variables including the
patient's biometric measurements, blood test, hormone data, and other symptoms. All of them are
numerical and binary data. Model selection will be performed to select the most effective models for this
dataset. Models for comparison include Logistic Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression,
Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Bagging Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier,
and XGB Classifier. This innovative approach seeks to better evaluate the patient’s situation based on 
the likelihood of PCOS, ultimately improving the overall management and treatment of PCOS.
